# OOPS Concepts
### 1) Encapsulation
  - keeping data and functionality together is called encapsulation 
    - data -> member variables
    - functionality -> method
  - Class is an implementation of the encapsulation concept of OOPS
  - This term comes from medicine capsule -> capsule needs a runtime env(human body) where it can show its behavior(to take away some issues), it will not work if you keep a capsule in an almirah, as it has small particles which can be treated as data.
  - When data changes the behaviour also changes

### 2) Abstraction
### 3) Inheritance
### 4) Polymorphism
