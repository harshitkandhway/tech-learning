# OOPS Concepts
### 1) Encapsulation
  - keeping data and functionality together is called encapsulation 
    - data -> member variables
    - functionality -> method
  - Class is an implementation of the encapsulation concept of OOPS
  - This term comes from medicine capsule -> capsule needs a runtime env(human body) where it can show its behavior(to take away some issues), it will not work if you keep a capsule in an almirah, as it has small particles which can be treated as data.
  - When data changes the behaviour also changes

### 2) Abstraction
  - Hiding the data(data members not functions) from the external world is abstraction.(making data variable as private)
  - Hiding methods is not abstraction.(creating a private method is never a part of abstraction)
  - When there is a class there is an abstraction, hence abstraction comes into the picture when there is encapsulation

### 3) Inheritance
  - When a class A wants to use the functions of class B, it can do that using inheritance
  - This is a parent-child relation
  - Single, Multi-level and hierarchical inheritance is allowed in Java
  - No Multiple Inheritance and no Hybrid Inheritance are required.
   
### 4) Polymorphism 
  - Having the same name but many forms
  - In OOP language there are 2 types of polymorphism :
      -  Object level polymorphism
      -  Function level polymorphism
   
  - Further, we have compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
