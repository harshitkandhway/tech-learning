### Reinforcement Learning
1) Environment in AI is the surroundings or circumstances in which the AI system functions.
2) Agent: It is the AI/mind that navigates the environment and learns from the feedback given by the environment while it performs certain actions.
3) The agent does actions on the environment which changes the state and gets a reward. By repeating this process the agent will keep on learning and exploring the environment about which action results in a good reward and a favorable state.
